1. Place input data into `/in/` folder.

 Note that the set file names should start with 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'.
 
 Example: `a_example.in` or `c_medium.txt`

2. Open `solution.js` and start typing your solution.

 You'll get `firstLine` and `input` as input parameters (also parsed if any data is integer).
 
 Return the output data you want to be dumped to the output file, 
    either as a string (whole file as string) OR
    as an array (rows of strings) OR
    as an array of arrays (rows and columns of strings or numbers).
    
3. Run the code and inspect the `/out/` folder
     - using vscode targets in debug (all sets at once or specific sets).
     - using CLI (run `node index` for all sets or `node index a,b,c` to execute the solution for specific set/s)
